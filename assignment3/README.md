# Implement a message board using typescript
- Navigation with “Add new message” and “Messages” links
   - “Messages” link shows the number of unread messages
   - If more than 5 it should show “5+”
- “Messages” shows all messages
   - A message consists of a subject and a body
   - Special styling for unread messages
   - Clicking a message should mark them as read
   - Red text at the top shows unread messages count, if any
- “Add messages” should open a form to add a new message
   - Form must accept a subject and a body
   - Use a button to send the message
   - Form should be emptied when switching between links
